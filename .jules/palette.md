## 2024-05-24 - Add accessible close buttons to modals
**Learning:** Found a pattern across multiple modal components (`EditTripModal`, `LuggagePickerModal`, `InventoryPickerModal`) where icon-only close buttons lacked `aria-label`s and the modals lacked `Escape` key close handlers.
**Action:** When creating or editing modals in the future, ensure that icon-only buttons have descriptive `aria-label`s and that keyboard accessibility (like the Escape key) is implemented to close the modals.

## 2024-05-24 - Enhance PasteListModal accessibility
**Learning:** Found a specific a11y issue pattern where dynamically generated list elements (like individual quantity/name inputs in PasteListModal) were missing `aria-label`s, preventing screen readers from associating the inputs with the item they belong to. Additionally, secondary row actions (like 'Remove' buttons) were only visible on mouse `hover` (`group-hover:opacity-100`), making them completely invisible to keyboard-only users who are tab-navigating the list.
**Action:** Always ensure dynamic inputs in mapped lists include `aria-label`s that interpolate the row's context (e.g., \`aria-label={\`Quantity for ${item.name}\`}\`), and ensure hover-only actions also include `focus:opacity-100` or `focus-visible:opacity-100` alongside proper outline rings for keyboard accessibility.
